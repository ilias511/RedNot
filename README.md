# HOW TO USE THE APPCLICATION AND FOR WHAT PURPOSE DOES THIS APP EXISTS?

This is my first project with django framework,so on how to use the app,think of a social media app like reddit where you sign up and make posts about anything you are interested,
and the purpose is just to join and read something interesting that maybe you didn't know.

# HOW TO OPEN THE PROJECT

To open it you need to start a new project and import my git repository as a project.

# Enjoy
